<span>A culture and nature-focused traveller, I grew up bilingual in the UK and have spent the past decade deepening my understanding of the cultural differences between the two languages I have now been working with for six years.
<br><br>
I have spent many long periods throughout my life in Germany and also Spain, during which my intercultural and organisational skills, flexibility, ability to face challenges head-on and desire to help others have all been invaluable, as have been my spirit of adventure and aim to live in the moment.
<br><br>
My background, experience, skills and interest in culture are the reasons why I set up ZBP Language Services in 2017, so that I could continue to help others by applying everything I have learnt along the way.</span>
